Highlight: Spotlight for windows
--------------------------------

### Goals
In the order of importance and implementation plans.

1. Useful: I want this tool for myself, something instead of Windows search
2. Fast: lag-free visually, results as fast as received
3. Pretty: `a e s t h e t i c s`
4. Customizable: through built-in menus and configuration files
5. Pluginabble: provide easy to use interfaces for plugins

### Random thoughts for myself
Personalization: login to google for calendar, gmail  
Persistance: reminder, history   
Providers: google (knowledge api?), file search, personalized sources  
Plugins: trigger through text matching, maybe NLP (knowledge apis)?  
File search: NTFS master record instead of indexing,
